# Introduction

The purpose of this visual experiment is to see if color has an effect on how easily people can interpret data. 

After the user clicks a start button, we will show a screen with two frames, each with random scattered color dots inside. After a set amount of time, the dots will disappear, and the user will guess which frame has more dots. The test will be repeated a certain amount of times.
